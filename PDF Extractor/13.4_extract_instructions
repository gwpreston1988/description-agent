You are Claude Code helping me build a small Python tool to parse manufacturer PDFs into a normalized JSON spec format for my 13.4 SEER2 product descriptions.

CONTEXT ABOUT THE PROJECT
- I run an HVAC e-commerce site.
- I have a set of PDFs in this project under: ./pdfs/13-4/
- I have a text file listing all the 13.4 SEER2 SKUs I care about under: ./13-4-skus.txt
- I need you to:
  1) Read the SKUs from that file,
  2) For each model, figure out which PDF to use and what equipment_type it is,
  3) Extract the relevant text from the PDF (where its specs live),
  4) Convert that text into a normalized JSON object using the schemas below,
  5) Output a single JSON file that contains one spec object per SKU.

IMPORTANT DOMAIN RULES
- These are all 13.4 SEER2 systems. For condensers in this family, SEER2 must be set to 13.4 even if the PDF shows a different number or range.
- We are not generating “bundle/system” JSON in this step. Only **single equipment** spec JSON:
  - AC condenser
  - Standard air handler
  - Wall-hung air handler
  - Upflow / vertical evaporator coil
  - Horizontal evaporator coil
  - 80% furnace
  - 92% furnace
- Heat strips are listed separately (HKTSN / HKTSD models) and are not part of this 13.4 set.
- AWST wall-mounted air handlers include a heat kit (show it in their JSON). Standard AMST air handlers do NOT include or show heat kit info.

FILES & PATHS
- PDFs:
  - ./pdfs/13-4/SS-GLXS3B-R32.pdf        (AC condensers GLXS3BN…)
  - ./pdfs/13-4/SS-GAMST.pdf             (Air handlers AMST…)
  - ./pdfs/13-4/SS-GAWST-R32.pdf         (Wall hung air handlers AWST…)
  - ./pdfs/13-4/SS-GCOIL.pdf             (Coils CAPTA…, CHPTA…, 0230K00044)
  - ./pdfs/13-4/SS-GR9S80-GD9S80-R32.pdf (80% furnaces GR9S80…, GD9S80…)
  - ./pdfs/13-4/SS-GR9S92-R32.pdf        (92% furnaces GR9S92…)
- SKUs file:
  - ./13-4-skus.txt

MODEL FAMILIES AND MAPPINGS
Use the following prefix → equipment_type + PDF map:

- GLXS3BN → equipment_type: "ac_condenser", pdf: "SS-GLXS3B-R32.pdf"
- AMST    → equipment_type: "air_handler", pdf: "SS-GAMST.pdf"
- AWST    → equipment_type: "wall_hung_air_handler", pdf: "SS-GAWST-R32.pdf"
- CAPTA   → equipment_type: "evaporator_coil_upflow", pdf: "SS-GCOIL.pdf"
- CHPTA   → equipment_type: "evaporator_coil_horizontal", pdf: "SS-GCOIL.pdf"
- 0230K   → equipment_type: "evaporator_coil_horizontal", pdf: "SS-GCOIL.pdf"
- GR9S80  → equipment_type: "gas_furnace_80", pdf: "SS-GR9S80-GD9S80-R32.pdf"
- GD9S80  → equipment_type: "gas_furnace_80", pdf: "SS-GR9S80-GD9S80-R32.pdf"
- GR9S92  → equipment_type: "gas_furnace_92", pdf: "SS-GR9S92-R32.pdf"

If a model starts with one of these prefixes, use that mapping.

WHAT I WANT YOU TO BUILD
Please work directly in this repo and:

1. Create a Python module, e.g. parse_13_4_specs.py, that will:
   - Read the SKUs from ./13-4-skus.txt (one SKU per line, ignore blank lines or comments).
   - For each SKU, detect the correct equipment_type and PDF based on the prefix mapping above.
   - Open the appropriate PDF from ./pdfs/13-4/.
   - Extract the text for the product specification and dimensions sections that contain this model.
     - Easiest: iterate pages and look for the model_number string; when found, capture that page plus a couple following pages into a text snippet.
   - For now, put these snippets into an intermediate data structure: { model_number, equipment_type, pdf, raw_text }.

2. Using your own LLM reasoning (you, Claude) and the raw_text, map values into the correct JSON fields for that equipment_type:
   - Do NOT invent data that isn’t there.
   - It’s OK to infer tonnage from BTU (e.g. 18,000 BTU/h ≈ 1.5 tons) if that’s how the sheet is structured.
   - For GLXS3BN condensers in this family, set seer2 = 13.4 even if the PDF printout looks slightly different.
   - Cast numeric fields to numbers where appropriate.
   - If something is missing in the PDF, set the corresponding JSON field to null.

3. Produce a final JSON file in the project root called:
   - 13-4-specs.json

The structure should be EITHER:
- an array of objects, one per SKU, OR
- an object keyed by model_number, like:
  {
    "GLXS3BN1810": { ...fields... },
    "AMST24BU13": { ...fields... },
    ...
  }

I slightly prefer the second (object keyed by model_number).

HOW TO PROCEED
- First, inspect the directory and open ./13-4-skus.txt so you see the SKUs.
- Then open each of the PDFs in ./pdfs/13-4/ to confirm layout of the spec tables.
- Next, implement the Python code to build an intermediate JSON with { model_number, equipment_type, pdf, raw_text }.
- Then, for each equipment_type, implement a helper that takes (raw_text, equipment_type) and returns a normalized spec dict that matches the field IDs above.
  - You can do the field mapping logic using string matching and your own understanding of the PDF text.
- Finally, write the combined 13-4-specs.json file.

IMPORTANT STYLE NOTES
- Show me the code you write in full files, not snippets only.
- Aim for clear, maintainable code — small functions like:
  - detect_family(model)
  - extract_model_snippet(pdf_path, model)
  - parse_snippet_to_spec(raw_text, equipment_type)
- When you need to make assumptions, briefly explain them in comments.

Once you have the first full pass working for a few SKUs (one condenser, one air handler, one coil, one furnace), extend it to all of them and show me the resulting JSON structure.
