I'll help you create descriptions for SKUs 31-37 (14.3 SEER2 dual fuel systems). Let me first read the SKUS file and workflow.md to understand the existing format and rules.
Read SKUS, workflow.md
I can see SKUs 31-37 are dual fuel systems (Heat Pump + Gas Furnace + Evaporator Coil). Let me check what templates are available and read the necessary spec sheets.

Perfect! I can see existing templates for AC + Gas Furnace + Coil systems. I'll use one as a template for the dual fuel (Heat Pump + Gas Furnace + Coil) systems. Let me read a template and the necessary spec PDFs.

This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:
Analysis:
Let me chronologically analyze this conversation:

1. **User's First Message**: The user opened a file `/Users/georgepreston/description-agent/SKUS` and stated they need descriptions for SKUs 31-37, which are 14.3 SEER2 dual fuel systems (furnace and heat pump systems). They asked me to refer to workflow.md for rules.

2. **My Initial Response**: I read three files:
   - SKUS file - to see the SKU mappings
   - workflow.md - to understand the rules and template structure
   - An existing AC + Gas Furnace + Coil template (SKU 17-23 style)
   
3. **File Reading**: I attempted to read the heat pump spec PDF and successfully read it. I also read the gas furnace spec PDF. I attempted to read the CAPTA coil spec PDF but got an error that the file doesn't exist.

4. **Document Content Provided**: The user then provided two PDF documents as embedded content:
   - SS-GLZS4B-R32.pdf (Heat Pump specifications)
   - SS-GR9S92-R32.pdf (Gas Furnace specifications)

5. **Current Status**: I created a todo list with 7 tasks for SKUs 31-37 but haven't started creating any descriptions yet.

**Key Technical Details**:
- SKUs 31-37 are Heat Pump + Gas Furnace + Evaporator Coil systems (3-component dual fuel systems)
- All use GLZS4BA heat pumps (not GLXS4BA air conditioners)
- All use GR9S92 gas furnaces
- All use CAPTA upflow coils (not CHPTA horizontal coils)
- These are 14.3 SEER2 systems
- Per workflow.md, these require:
  - 3 tabs (Heat Pump, Gas Furnace, Evaporator Coil)
  - Title format: "GOODMAN X.X Ton 14.3 SEER2 R-32 92% AFUE Gas Furnace Heat Pump System (Upflow Coil)"
  - Intro mentioning year-round comfort with both HP and furnace heating
  - Include SEER2, HSPF2, and AFUE ratings
  - Component cards for all three components
  - Warranty section with 10-year parts, 10-year compressor, and Lifetime heat exchanger
  - DOE footer - since SEER2 is 14.3, it meets DOE requirements for all U.S. climate zones

**Specific SKU Mappings from SKUS file**:
- SKU 31: GLZS4BA1810, GR9S920403ANA, CAPTA2422A3
- SKU 32: GLZS4BA2410, GR9S920403ANA, CAPTA2422A3
- SKU 33: GLZS4BA3010, GR9S920603BNA, CAPTA3626B3
- SKU 34: GLZS4BA3610, GR9S920603BNA, CAPTA3626B3
- SKU 35: GLZS4BA4210, GR9S920804CNA, CAPTA4230C3
- SKU 36: GLZS4BA4810, GR9S920804CNA, CAPTA6030C3
- SKU 37: GLZS4BA6010, GR9S921005CNA, CAPTA6030C3

**User's Second Message**: The user asked for a detailed summary of the conversation.

       ```
   
   - **`/Users/georgepreston/description-agent/workflow.md`**:
     - Complete workflow guide for all product types
     - Section 4 (lines 160-200) covers Heat Pump + Gas Furnace + Evaporator Coil Systems
     - Key requirements:
       - Page title format: "GOODMAN X.X Ton XX.X SEER2 R-32 XX% AFUE Gas Furnace Heat Pump System (Upflow/Horizontal Coil)"
       - Intro paragraph mentioning year-round comfort with both HP and furnace heating
       - Three component cards (HP, Furnace, Coil)

       - Warranty: 10-year parts, 10-year compressor, Lifetime heat exchanger
       - DOE footer based on SEER2 rating
   
   - **`/Users/georgepreston/description-agent/Description Directory/Goodman_15Ton_R32_92AFUE_GasFurnace_System_GLXS4BA1810_GR9S920403ANA_CAPTA2422A3.html`**:
     - Template for AC + Gas Furnace + Coil systems (similar structure needed)
     - Contains complete HTML structure with:
       - CSS styling (lines 7-360)
       - Intro section
       - Component cards
       - Tab structure with JavaScript
       - Specification tables for each component
       - Warranty section
       - DOE compliance footer
     - Will need to adapt this for Heat Pump systems (different specs, heating capabilities)
   
   - **SS-GLZS4B-R32.pdf** (Heat Pump Specifications):
     - Page 3 contains product specifications table with all heat pump models
     - Includes cooling capacity, heating capacity, SEER2, HSPF2, EER2, electrical specs, dimensions

4. **Errors and Fixes**:
   - **Error**: Attempted to read `/Users/georgepreston/description-agent/pdfs/Air_Handlers_and_Coils/SS-CAPTA-R32.pdf` but file does not exist
   - **Fix**: User provided the necessary PDF specifications as embedded document content in the conversation, so I can extract the needed information from the provided PDFs

5. **Problem Solving**:
   - Identified the correct template type needed: Heat Pump + Gas Furnace + Coil (3-tab system)
   - Determined these are different from the AC + Gas Furnace systems (SKUs 17-30) because they use heat pumps instead of air conditioners
   - Heat pumps provide both heating and cooling, so descriptions must emphasize "year-round comfort" and include heating specifications (HSPF2, heating capacity)
   - Confirmed all systems use upflow coils (CAPTA series) based on SKU mappings

6. **All User Messages**:
   - "now i need descriptions for skus 31-37 these are 14.3 seer2 dual fuel (funrace and heat pump systems) refer to workflow md to know the rules"
   - Request for detailed conversation summary

7. **Pending Tasks**:
   - Create HTML description for SKU 31: GLZS4BA1810 + GR9S920403ANA + CAPTA2422A3 (1.5 ton)
   - Create HTML description for SKU 32: GLZS4BA2410 + GR9S920403ANA + CAPTA2422A3 (2 ton)
   - Create HTML description for SKU 33: GLZS4BA3010 + GR9S920603BNA + CAPTA3626B3 (2.5 ton)
   - Create HTML description for SKU 34: GLZS4BA3610 + GR9S920603BNA + CAPTA3626B3 (3 ton)
   - Create HTML description for SKU 35: GLZS4BA4210 + GR9S920804CNA + CAPTA4230C3 (3.5 ton)
   - Create HTML description for SKU 36: GLZS4BA4810 + GR9S920804CNA + CAPTA6030C3 (4 ton)
   - Create HTML description for SKU 37: GLZS4BA6010 + GR9S921005CNA + CAPTA6030C3 (5 ton)

8. **Current Work**:
   I had just created a todo list to track the 7 SKU descriptions that need to be created. I was preparing to start creating the descriptions but had not yet begun writing any HTML files. The next step would be to extract the specific specifications from the PDFs for each component and use an existing template (likely adapting an AC + Gas Furnace + Coil template) to create Heat Pump + Gas Furnace + Coil descriptions.
   
   The key difference from previous work (SKUs 17-30) is that these systems use GLZS4BA heat pumps instead of GLXS4BA air conditioners, meaning:
   - They provide both heating and cooling
   - Must include HSPF2 ratings
   - Must include heating capacity specifications
   - Intro text emphasizes "year-round comfort" from dual fuel (heat pump + gas furnace)
   - Tab 1 is "Heat Pump" instead of "Air Conditioner"

9. **Optional Next Step**:
   Begin creating the first description (SKU 31) by:
   - Reading an existing Heat Pump + Gas Furnace + Coil template if one exists (to check if any SKUs 24-30 were created)
   - If not, adapt the AC + Gas Furnace + Coil template
   - Extract specifications for GLZS4BA1810, GR9S920403ANA, and CAPTA2422A3 from the PDFs
   - Create the complete HTML file following the workflow.md guidelines for Heat Pump + Gas Furnace + Coil systems
   
   **Direct quote from conversation**: User stated "now i need descriptions for skus 31-37 these are 14.3 seer2 dual fuel (funrace and heat pump systems)" - I created a todo list with all 7 SKUs but have not started creating any descriptions yet..
Please continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on.
I'll continue creating the descriptions for SKUs 31-37. Let me first check if there's an existing Heat Pump + Gas Furnace + Coil template I can use as a reference.

No existing Heat Pump + Gas Furnace + Coil templates found. I'll need to create them. Let me read the workflow.md file again to ensure I have the correct structure for Heat Pump + Gas Furnace + Coil systems.
Read workflow.md (lines 161-210)
Now let me read an existing AC + Gas Furnace + Coil template to understand the full structure, then I'll adapt it for heat pumps:
